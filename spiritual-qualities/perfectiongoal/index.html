<p align="center"><b>&nbsp;PERFECTION-GOAL <br /></b></p>
<p align="center">by: Sri Chinmoy<b><br /></b> </p>
<p>  Perfection is the seeker&#8217;s fulfilling realisation and fulfilled  manifestation. Everything else has dawned on earth save perfection,  perfect Perfection. Perfection is the tree. Perfect Perfection is the  fruit.&nbsp; </p>
<p>  Man&#8217;s speculation about perfection is his ignorance. Man&#8217;s  concentration on perfection is his knowledge. Man&#8217;s meditation on  perfection is his wisdom. Man&#8217;s contemplation on perfection is his  world-illumining, world-transforming inner eye.&nbsp; </p>
<p></p>
<div align="center">  God&#8217;s Message is Perfection. </div>
<p align="center">  Man&#8217;s message is temptation. </p>
<p align="center">  God&#8217;s Message is Perfection.</p>
<p align="center">  &nbsp;Man&#8217;s message is frustration. </p>
<p align="center">  God&#8217;s Message is Perfection.</p>
<p align="center">  Man&#8217;s message is destruction.&nbsp; </p>
<p>  Perfection-Goal and the freedom-soul go together. He who reaches the  state of freedom-soul has conquered his inner life and immortalised his  outer life. He is the chosen instrument of God. He is the direct  channel of God. He is the representative of God here on earth.&nbsp; </p>
<p>  Cry and try. When we cry to see the Transcendental Light and when we  try to perfect our outer nature, our perfection does not remain a far  cry. Perfection is ours.&nbsp; </p>
<p>  Exert and control. When we exert the divine in us and control the  animal in us, perfection begins to dawn within us. The flower of  perfection blooms.&nbsp; </p>
<p>  See and be. When we try to see the truth with the Eye of God, not with  our eyes, and when we consciously try to be the surrendered instrument  of God, perfection in no time dawns. The Golden All of perfection  beckons our aspiring hearts. It is true that perfection cannot be  achieved overnight. Realisation cannot be achieved all at once. It  takes time.&nbsp; </p>
<p>  Let me tell you a story. A young seeker once came up to a spiritual  Master for initiation, and was duly initiated. Then the following day  he said, &#8220;Master, now that you have initiated me, you have to give me  realisation. I want to see God.&#8221; The Master said, &#8220;My child, how is it  possible for you to realise God in one day?&#8221;&nbsp; </p>
<p>  Two days later, the seeker said, &#8220;Oh, I want to realise God.&#8221;&nbsp; </p>
<p>  The Master said, &#8220;You are not ready.&#8221;&nbsp; </p>
<p>  A few days later, again the same request: &#8220;Master, I want to realise  God.&#8221; He had not completed his task. He had not launched into the  spiritual path properly. Just the other day the Master had initiated  him, but now he was crying for realisation without following the proper  method. Without swimming in the sea of aspiration, he wanted to realise  God.&nbsp; </p>
<p>  On his way to the Ganges for a dip, the Master invited this particular  disciple to come with him. As the two entered the water, the Master  pressed the disciple&#8217;s head underwater for a couple of minutes. When he  released it, the Master asked, &#8220;What did you feel when I was pressing  your head into the water?&#8221;&nbsp; </p>
<p>  &#8220;Master, I was gasping for air. I was practically dying and I thought I  would not survive. The moment you released me, I got my life back.&#8221;&nbsp; </p>
<p>  The Master said, &#8220;If you can come to that same state of consciousness  and feel that without God you cannot live even for a few minutes, you  will realise God. You will realise God at that moment on the strength  of your highest aspiration. Your inmost inner flame has to be kindled,  and then you have to cry&#8212;cry for God as a child cries for his mother.  Only then is God-realisation possible.&#8221;&nbsp; </p>
<p>  The disciple learnt the lesson. Truly and soulfully he entered into the  spiritual life and listened to his Master&#8217;s dictates. Wholeheartedly he  launched into the spiritual life. He felt the necessity of freedom from  the domain of desires. He felt the necessity to grow into the mounting  flame of aspiration, constant aspiration.&nbsp; </p>
<p>  Then realisation for him was not a far cry. He did realise God.&nbsp; </p>
<p>  When we use the term &#8216;Heaven&#8217;, we feel Heaven is all light, delight and  perfection. But where is that Heaven? It is deep within us, in the  inmost recesses of our hearts. High Heaven, higher Heaven and highest  Heaven are all within us. When we offer our soulful thoughts to our  brothers and sisters, we live in high Heaven. When we offer the results  of our soulful actions to mankind, we live in higher Heaven. Finally,  when we offer our soulful existence to humanity at large, unreservedly  and unconditionally, we live in the highest Heaven.&nbsp; </p>
<p>  We can live in the highest Heaven every day. God has given us the  capacity. He has given us the potentiality. It is we who have to  manifest our inner potentiality and capacity. We all are surcharged  with indomitable inner courage. Unfortunately, we do not use our inner  unlimited capacity. We use our outer limited capacity. We are afraid of  diving deep within. Inside is the treasure. Inside is the key. We do  not know where we have kept the key. We have totally forgotten. We do  not know where the treasure lies.&nbsp; </p>
<p>  At this point we see the need for a spiritual Master who knows where  the key is and where the treasure lies. He does not give something of  his own to the seeker. He only brings to the fore the seeker&#8217;s inner  wealth. God-realisation is not his sole monopoly. Everybody will  realise God, without fail. It is a matter of time. One realises God  today on the strength of his inner inspiration. Another realises God  tomorrow on the strength of his sincere aspiration. Everybody will  realise God at God&#8217;s choice Hour. Again, those of us who are sincere  seekers can expedite our journey. We can walk towards our Goal. We can  march towards our Goal. We can run towards our Goal. If we run,  naturally we shall reach the Goal sooner than those who are walking  towards their Destination.&nbsp; </p>
<p>  Perfection-Goal. Perfect Perfection here on earth has to be manifested,  but how? We have to start our journey with inspiration. We have to feel  every day deep within us in all our activities the necessity of  inspiration. Without inspiration, there can be no proper achievement.  Then we have to go one step further. After inspiration we have to feel  the momentous necessity of aspiration. Inspiration is not all. We have  to aspire to reach the Golden All, to see the Golden Shores of the  Beyond, the ever-transcending Beyond. This is what we expect from  aspiration, the mounting flame within us.&nbsp; </p>
<p>  But, aspiration is not enough either. We have to meditate. Aspiration  includes meditation. When we meditate, we have to feel that we are  entering into Infinity, Eternity and Immortality. These are not vague  terms, but our true possessions. To some day enter into our own divine  possessions&#8212;Infinity, Eternity and Immortality&#8212;is our birthright.&nbsp; </p>
<p>  Then, when we become advanced in our meditation, when meditation starts  offering us its fruit, we enter into the realm of realisation. We  realise the highest Truth in this body, here on earth. We do not have  to go elsewhere to realise God. We do not have to enter an Himalayan  cave or sit on a snow-capped mountain in order to practise  spirituality. No. Here on earth, in the hustle and bustle of life, we  have to practise spirituality. We have to accept earth as it stands, as  it is. If we are afraid of earth, if we shy away from earth, then  God-realisation will always remain a far cry. Here on earth we have to  realise the highest Truth.&nbsp; </p>
<p>  But even realisation is not enough. After realisation we have to reveal  our realisation. If we do not reveal our realisation, we act like a  miser, hoarding our treasure. This is not right. We have to offer our  realisation in the form of revelation to mankind.&nbsp; </p>
<p>  Yet revelation is not enough either. We have to enter into the domain  of manifestation. If we do not manifest what we have realised here on  earth, if Mother Earth does not receive the fruit of our realisation,  and if She does not have it for good, we can never be truly fulfilled.  Mother Earth has to be fed with the fruit of our realisation. Here on  earth the manifestation of realisation has to take place; and when  manifestation takes place, perfection is bound to dawn. Perfect  Perfection is nothing other than the absolute manifestation of God&#8217;s  Transcendental Will here on earth.&nbsp; </p>
<p>  We are all seekers of the infinite Truth. It is our bounden duty to  rise high, higher, highest. Each human being has come into the world  with the message of perfection. No human being on earth will remain  unrealised. No human being on earth will remain unfulfilled. No human  being on earth will remain imperfect. Realisation, fulfilment and  perfection: these are three brothers. Realisation is the youngest,  fulfilment is the middle, and perfect Perfection is the eldest in the  family. These three brothers must go together. They have to walk along  the field of aspiration. They have to swim in the sea of meditation.  They have to fly in the sky, the blue welkin of contemplation.&nbsp; </p>
<p>  God-realisation, God-revelation and God-manifestation can take place  only when man feels that he has to transcend himself. His goal of today  is not the Ultimate Goal. Today&#8217;s goal has to be transcended tomorrow.  Today&#8217;s goal is the foundation-stone. Every moment we have to transcend  ourselves and, while transcending, deep within us we shall cherish the  message of perfection.&nbsp; </p>
<p>  Perfection is bound to loom large and important in all our activities  if we feel that aspiration is the only thing we need, the only thing we  are striving for. In aspiration lies the key that can ultimately open  up the door of perfect Perfection. </p>
