<p align="center">Let us be sincere. The Supreme will bless us.<br />Let us be pure. The Supreme will love us.<br />Let us be sure of our Goal. The Supreme will embrace us. </p>
<p align="right">- Sri Chinmoy</p>
<p>  &#8220;Let us be sincere. The Supreme will bless us.&#8221; An aspirant has to be  sincere, not only in his inner life but also in his outer life, until  he breathes his last. Sincerity is the fertile ground in the aspirant&#8217;s  heart. His sincerity is God&#8217;s matchless Smile. His sincerity is God&#8217;s  peerless Pride.&nbsp; </p>
<p>  Sincerity can be developed. It can be developed like a muscle. There  are some people who are naturally sincere, and others who are naturally  insincere. Those who are sincere from the dawn of their lives are  blessed. But those who are insincere from their very birth need not and  must not curse themselves. They can be sincere if they want to. The  moment they truly want to be sincere, God in His Infinite Compassion  will help them. With His deepest Joy, Pride and Concern He will help  them.&nbsp; </p>
<p>  Spirituality needs and demands sincerity from the beginning to the end.  Spirituality and sincerity can never be separated. If one really cares  for the spiritual life, if one feels that spirituality is the only  answer, then I wish to say that sincerity is the key that opens the  door of spirituality. There is no other key; there can be no other  key.&nbsp; </p>
<p>  &#8220;Let us be pure. The Supreme will love us.&#8221; If there is no purity in  the aspirant&#8217;s inner or outer life, then the aspirant is no better than  an animal. Without purity he cannot retain any of the spiritual gifts  he receives. Everything will disappear and everything will disappoint  the seeker if he is wanting in purity. But if he is flooded with  purity, the divine qualities will all eventually enter into him. They  will sing in him, dance in him and make him the happiest person on  earth. And, by making him happy, these divine qualities will find their  own true fulfilment.&nbsp; </p>
<p>  Purity in the physical is of paramount importance. This does not mean  that we have to bathe ten times a day. No, purity is not that. Purity  does demand that you have a clean body, but true physical purity lies  inside the heart. You have to establish an inner shrine within your  heart. This shrine is the constant remembrance of the Supreme Pilot  inside you. When you constantly and spontaneously think of the Supreme  Pilot seated inside you, in the inmost recesses of your heart, you will  realise that this is the highest purity. If purity is lacking in the  physical, complete success, the full manifestation of God, cannot be  accomplished. You may get partial spiritual success, but even this  partial success in life will disappoint you badly if purity is not  established in your nature.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>  You have to establish purity in the physical, in the vital, in the  mind&#8212;everywhere in the outer nature. Then whatever you do, whatever you  are, whatever you possess will be filled with purity. Purity is not  something weak or negative; it is something soulful and dynamic. It is  something that is fed constantly by the infinite Energy and  indomitable, adamantine Will of the Supreme.&nbsp; </p>
<p>  The very utterance of the word &#8216;purity&#8217; can help to change the  aspirant&#8217;s outer life as well as his inner life. Repeat the word  &#8216;purity&#8217; one hundred and eight times daily, placing your right hand on  your navel as you say it. Then you will see that abundant purity will  enter into you and flow through you. When you are pure, you will see  the world with a different eye. You will see purity dawning fast in the  world. You will see beauty blooming fast in the world. You will see  perfection growing fast in the world.&nbsp; </p>
<p>  Sweet, sweeter, sweetest is purity. When you see purity inside you, you  are pure. When you feel purity inside and around you, you are purer.  When you become purity within and without, you are purest. You actually  kill your inner being when you lead an impure life. But when you lead a  pure life, you expedite the journey of your soul. Your soul and your  outer life get their greatest opportunity when purity is totally  established in your life.&nbsp; </p>
<p>  &#8220;Let us be sure of our Goal. The Supreme will embrace us.&#8221; The  difference between an ordinary man and an aspirant is that an ordinary  man has no goal, whereas an aspirant does. An ordinary man is satisfied  with what he has, or considers the idea of entering into the Beyond as  beyond his imagination, or feels that there is no Beyond. He is caught  by what he sees around him. An aspirant, however, feels and believes  that this world of ours is not the final Goal. He feels that there must  be a Goal somewhere, and he knows that either this Goal will come to  him or he will have to go to it. The Goal may be God-realisation or it  may be something else. If it is God-realisation and if his aspiration  is sincere, he should know that this Goal is something absolutely  important and sacred. It is not a plaything.&nbsp; </p>
<p>  An aspirant has to be sure of his Goal. He may want God or some  attribute of God. Some aspirants cry to God for Power, for Love, for  Peace. They do not cry to God for God Himself. They do not want God in  His Infinity and Eternity. They want only a portion of Him. They are  satisfied if they can get Peace from God, or Light, or Love. When they  receive what they cry for, they end their soul&#8217;s journey. But there are  some aspirants who do not want anything from God except God Himself.  They feel that if they get God, they get everything. They are like  hungry children in a garden where there is a tree laden with the most  delicious mangoes. They know that if they can please the owner of the  tree they will get all the mangoes on the tree. Here God is the owner  of the tree and, at the same time, He is the tree. When we please Him,  He satisfies our hunger for infinite Light, Peace and Bliss. If the  aspirants are wise, they know that the moment they please God they get  everything from Him.&nbsp; </p>
<p>  On the strength of his sincere aspiration, a true seeker says, &#8220;O God,  if You feel that I should have Your Vision, if You feel that You want  to fulfil Yourself in me and through me, if You feel that You can  utilise me as Your instrument, I am at Your service. If You want me to  stand before You, I shall come and stand. If You want to stand before  me, I shall be equally happy. If You do not want either, but want  somebody else to stand before You, I shall still be happy.&#8221; This is  what we call surrender. This is the ultimate surrender.&nbsp; </p>
<p>  An aspirant has to know his Goal. If his Goal is God-realisation, he  can start with that in mind. But the Ultimate Goal is unconditional  surrender to God&#8217;s Will. When God sees that His child, His most devoted  child, has made this unconditional surrender&#8212;not for a second, not for  a day or a year, but for a whole lifetime, for all incarnations to  come, for all Eternity&#8212;then alone God embraces His dearest, His  sweetest, His most devoted child. And when that embrace takes place,  man changes into God Himself.&nbsp; </p>
<p>  We are all, without exception, given the opportunity to fulfil God here on earth. If we try, we are bound to succeed. We can fulfil God and, in fulfilling Him, we shall see that we are already fulfilled. </p>
